        <p>
          The journey to becoming pioneers in the space of school management
          softwares was marked in June of 2013. Starting with just two pilot
          schools, we have ascended our way to becoming one of Indiaâ€™s most
          trusted school ERP software. With over 7 years in the business now and
          after serving more than 300 schools, our extremely passionate and
          driven team has been able to look very closely at the challenges faced
          by schools and provide digital solutions to the same.
